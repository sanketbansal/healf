## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd healf

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Setup Method

#### Option A: Docker Setup (Recommended for Development & Production)

**⚠️ Important**: Our application requires MongoDB and Redis for full functionality. Docker provides these services automatically.

```bash
# Generate Docker configuration
python scripts/generate_docker_config.py development

# Start all services (API + MongoDB + Redis)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build
```

#### Option B: Local Development (Testing Only - Limited Functionality)

**⚠️ Note**: This setup is suitable for **testing only** as it lacks database services. The application will use fallback logic and won't persist data.

**Prerequisites**: This requires manually setting up MongoDB and Redis if you want full functionality:

```bash
# Option B1: Manual database setup (if you want full functionality)
# Install and start MongoDB (port 27017)
# Install and start Redis (port 6379)

# Option B2: Testing mode (fallback logic only)
# Start the application (uses development config with fallback logic)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Limitations of Local Setup**:
- ❌ No data persistence (profiles won't be saved)
- ❌ No Redis caching (slower performance)  
- ❌ Limited WebSocket session management
- ✅ API endpoints work with fallback responses
- ✅ LLM integration uses intelligent fallbacks
- ✅ Testing and validation still functional

### Step 4: Verify It's Working

#### For Docker Setup (Full Functionality):
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected response: {"status":"healthy","service":"healf-api","version":"1.0.0"}

# Test profile creation with persistence
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profile/init/test_user

# Test profile retrieval (should work with data persistence)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profile/test_user

# View API documentation
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

#### For Local Setup (Testing Mode):
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected response: {"status":"healthy","service":"healf-api","version":"1.0.0"}

# Test profile creation (will work but won't persist)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profile/init/test_user

# Note: Profile retrieval may fail or return fallback data without databases

# View API documentation
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Step 5: Test the Complete Workflow

```bash
# Run the interactive wellness profiling demo
python tests/test_websocket_demo.py

# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Expected: 9 tests passing (8 API + 1 WebSocket)
```

**🎉 That's it! Your wellness platform is now running on `http://localhost:8000`**

## 💬 Interactive Chat UI (Web Interface)

### Real-Time Conversational Testing

We've included a fully functional **chat interface** (`chat_ui.html`) that provides a beautiful web-based UI for testing the conversational wellness profiling experience. This interface connects directly to the WebSocket endpoint and demonstrates the complete user journey.

#### **🎯 How to Use the Chat UI**

1. **Start your development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Docker setup (recommended)
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build
   
   # OR local setup
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Open the chat interface**:
   ```bash
   # Open the chat UI in your browser
   open chat_ui.html
   
   # OR navigate to:
   file:///path/to/your/healf/chat_ui.html
   ```

3. **Start a conversation**:
   - Click **"Start Chat"** to connect to the WebSocket
   - The assistant will greet you and ask your first question
   - Type natural responses like "hi", "I'm 28", "male", "active", etc.
   - Watch your profile completion progress in real-time

#### **🌟 Chat UI Features**

- **🎨 Modern Interface**: Beautiful gradient design with connection status indicators
- **⚡ Real-Time Communication**: Instant WebSocket messaging with typing indicators
- **📊 Progress Tracking**: Visual profile completion percentage with progress bar
- **🔄 Connection Management**: Connect/disconnect controls with status feedback
- **💬 Natural Conversation**: Supports casual responses like "hi", "male", "active", "fitness"
- **🤖 Intelligent Responses**: Fallback questions when OpenAI API key is not available
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

#### **🗣️ Example Conversation Flow**

```
🤖 Healf Assistant: To get started, could you tell me your age? This helps us tailor recommendations for your life stage.

👤 You: hi
🤖 Healf Assistant: Hello! Nice to meet you. What's your age?

👤 You: 28
🤖 Healf Assistant: Great! I've noted your age. What gender do you identify as? This helps us provide more personalized wellness advice.

👤 You: male  
🤖 Healf Assistant: Great! I've noted your gender. How would you describe your current activity level? Are you more sedentary, moderately active, or very active?

👤 You: active
🤖 Healf Assistant: Great! I've noted your activity level. Do you follow any specific dietary preferences? For example, are you vegan, vegetarian, or have no specific preference?

👤 You: vegan
🤖 Healf Assistant: Great! I've noted your dietary preference. How would you rate your sleep quality overall? Would you say it's poor, average, or good?

👤 You: good
🤖 Healf Assistant: Great! I've noted your sleep quality. What's your current stress level like? Would you describe it as low, medium, or high?

👤 You: low  
🤖 Healf Assistant: Great! I've noted your stress level. What are your main health and wellness goals? What would you like to achieve or improve?

👤 You: fitness
🤖 Healf Assistant: 🎉 Congratulations! Your wellness profile is now complete! You're ready for personalized recommendations.

📊 Profile Completion: 100%
```

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation**

The chat UI demonstrates several key technical features:

- **WebSocket Integration**: Direct connection to `/ws/{user_id}` endpoint
- **Message Format Handling**: Supports both chat UI format (`user_message`) and structured format (`USER_ANSWER`)
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Natural language processing to extract profile information from casual responses
- **Fallback Logic**: When OpenAI API keys are not available, uses pre-written intelligent questions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection issues and malformed messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time calculation and display of profile completion percentage

#### **🎨 Chat UI Technical Details**

```html
<!-- Key Features in chat_ui.html -->
✅ WebSocket connection management
✅ Real-time message exchange  
✅ Progress bar with completion tracking
✅ Connection status indicators
✅ Responsive design with modern UI
✅ Error handling and reconnection logic
✅ Typing indicators and timestamps
```

#### **💡 Testing Scenarios**

The chat UI is perfect for testing:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Try various ways of expressing the same information
   - Age: "I'm 28", "28 years old", "twenty-eight"
   - Activity: "I work out daily", "active", "I exercise regularly"
   - Diet: "I'm vegan", "plant-based", "no meat or dairy"

2. **Edge Cases**: Test how the system handles:
   - Casual greetings: "hi", "hello", "hey there"
   - Unclear responses: "not sure", "maybe", "idk"
   - Multiple pieces of info: "I'm a 28-year-old active male"

3. **Connection Resilience**: Test WebSocket stability:
   - Disconnect and reconnect during conversation
   - Close browser tab and reopen
   - Network interruptions

#### **🚀 Using for Demos**

The chat UI is ideal for:
- **Client Presentations**: Visual demonstration of the conversational flow
- **User Testing**: Gather feedback on the user experience
- **Development Testing**: Quick testing without writing WebSocket client code
- **Feature Validation**: Verify new conversation logic and question flows

**💡 Pro Tip**: Since the system uses intelligent fallback questions when no OpenAI API key is provided, the chat UI works perfectly for demos without requiring external API access!

## 📄 Architecture Deep Dive

### Message Flow Architecture

```
1. WebSocket Connection → User connects to /ws/{user_id}
2. Profile Initialization → System creates/loads profile via ProfileDAO
3. Question Generation → LLM DAO generates contextual questions with fallbacks
4. Answer Processing → QuestionService extracts structured data from natural language
5. Profile Updates → ProfileDAO updates MongoDB + invalidates Redis cache
6. Completion Check → System calculates completion percentage
7. Next Question/Completion → Cycle continues until 100% complete
```

### Database Schema

**MongoDB Collection: `profiles`**
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "user_id": "string (unique)",
  "age": "int (13-120) | null",
  "gender": "string | null",
  "activity_level": "enum: sedentary|moderate|active | null", 
  "dietary_preference": "enum: vegan|vegetarian|no_preference | null",
  "sleep_quality": "enum: poor|average|good | null",
  "stress_level": "enum: low|medium|high | null",
  "health_goals": "string | null",
  "completion_percentage": "float (0.0-100.0)",
  "created_at": "datetime",
  "updated_at": "datetime"
}
```

**Redis Cache Structure**:
- `profile:{user_id}` → Cached profile data (1 hour TTL)
- `session:{user_id}` → WebSocket session data
- `context:{user_id}` → Conversation context
- `websocket_stats` → Global connection statistics

## 🤖 LLM Integration

### **Multi-Provider Support**

The platform supports multiple LLM providers with automatic failover:

- **OpenAI** (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4)
- **Google Gemini** (gemini-pro)
- **Intelligent Fallback** - Pre-written questions when no providers are available

### **Configuration**

Set your API keys in environment variables or config files:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# Gemini Configuration  
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-pro

# Provider Selection (optional)
LLM_PROVIDER=openai  # or "gemini"
```

### **Provider Status**

Check which providers are available:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/llm
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "providers": [
    {"name": "OpenAIProvider", "available": true},
    {"name": "GeminiProvider", "available": false}
  ],
  "available_count": 1,
  "total_count": 2,
  "fallback_only": false
}
```

### **Automatic Failover**

The system automatically tries providers in order:
1. **Primary Provider** (configured via `LLM_PROVIDER`)
2. **Secondary Provider** (other available provider)
3. **Intelligent Fallback** (pre-written questions)

This ensures the conversation continues even if API services are unavailable.
